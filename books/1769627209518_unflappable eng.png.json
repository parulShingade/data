  "bookDescription": "The Unflappable Leader: Ancient Indian Wisdom for Modern Challenges shows how modern leaders can stay calm, clear, and ethical under extreme pressure. The book argues that burnout, poor decisions, and ethical compromise don’t come from lack of effort—but from lack of inner stability.  Drawing from ancient Indian wisdom such as the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads, the book introduces three powerful leadership pillars: presence through meditation, detachment from outcomes (nishkama karma / vairagya), and witnessing awareness. Together, these practices help leaders act decisively without anxiety, manage stress without emotional suppression, and maintain ethical clarity even in crisis.  Rather than promoting control or aggression, the book teaches leaders to focus on skillful action, inner balance, and service-driven leadership. It reframes leadership as inner mastery first—so that external challenges are met with resilience, wisdom, and integrity.",
