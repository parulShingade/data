  "title": "Why People Say Yes: Timeless Psychological Forces That Shape Decisions",
  "author": "Dilip Sengupta",
  "bookDescription": "Why People Say Yes explores the hidden psychology behind human decisions and influence. The book explains that our choices are rarely purely logical; instead, they are shaped by mental shortcuts, emotions, social pressure, and deeply ingrained psychological patterns. It introduces the two thinking systems—fast, intuitive System 1 and slow, analytical System 2—and shows how most real-world decisions are driven by the automatic mind.  The book breaks down powerful principles like reciprocity, social proof, scarcity, authority, commitment, liking, and unity, explaining why people agree, comply, and follow others—often without realizing it. Through real-life and Indian-context examples, it shows how these forces operate in business, marketing, leadership, relationships, and everyday life.  Most importantly, the book emphasizes ethical influence—using psychology not to manipulate, but to build trust, connection, and long-term impact. It helps readers understand others better, make wiser decisions, and influence responsibly",
