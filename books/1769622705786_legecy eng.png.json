  "bookDescription": "True wealth isn't about what you earn. It’s about what you leave behind.  We live in a world obsessed with the next paycheck, the quick flip, and immediate gratification. But while income pays the bills today, only Legacy Money secures the future.  In this comprehensive guide, Gajendra S. Nair dismantles the myths of \"get rich quick\" schemes and replaces them with the proven, time-tested strategies used by the world’s most prosperous families. This isn't just a book about investing; it is a blueprint for building a financial fortress that withstands market volatility and spans generations.  Inside, you will discover how to:  Shift Your Mindset: Move from a consumer mentality to the disciplined perspective of a steward.  Master the Math: Harness the \"grow rich slow\" power of compounding and intelligent asset allocation.  Protect the Palace: Shield your wealth from inflation, litigation, and bad debt with robust legal frameworks.  Prepare the Heirs: Equip the next generation with the financial literacy and values to grow—not squander—their inheritance.  Stop working just for a living. Start building for a lifetime—and beyond.",
