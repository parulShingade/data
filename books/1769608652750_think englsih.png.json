  "bookDescription": "Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.  For over two decades, Napoleon Hill interviewed the 500 wealthiest men of his time—icons like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and John D. Rockefeller—to discover the key to their success. The result is Think and Grow Rich, the most influential book on personal achievement ever written.  This is not just a book about making money; it is a manual for unlocking the infinite potential of your own mind. Hill reveals the \"Carnegie Secret,\" a time-tested formula that transforms mere desires into tangible reality.  Discover the 13 Steps to Riches, including:  The Power of Desire: The starting point of all achievement.  The Master Mind: How to leverage the brainpower of others.  Auto-Suggestion: How to program your subconscious for success.  Persistence: The sustained effort necessary to induce faith.  Stop wishing for success. Start thinking it into existence.",
